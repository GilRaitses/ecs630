Orange Auto Part Manufacturer (10)

In an effort to minimize waste, the management for the OAPM has decided to recycle parts that
failinspection. The plant manager responsible for the OAPM has decided to send a cart twice a
day to pick up the parts that failed inspection: at 11 am and 3 pm. The plant manager has decided
to incorporate the holding and releasing of parts to the OAPM in the simulation.

Note: Assume that the OAPM's 8-hour daily shift begins at 9 am and goes until 5 pm.

Run the model for five 8-hour days. The base time units should be minutes.
Examine the effect of modeling the recycling hold on the throughput for failed inspection parts.
