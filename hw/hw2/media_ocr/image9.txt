Example (i)

A simulation study needs to be conducted to determine the best policy
for operating a coal deposit.

Trains transport the coal to this deposit (500 tons each time), but that
they arrive at intervals of irregular time (varying between 2 and 8 days).
The inter-arrival time has been studied statistically, obtaining the
frequencies of occurrence as below:
