Time Frame of Simulations

- Terminating - Steady-State

- Specific starting, stopping - Long-run(technically forever)
conaitions - Theoretically, initial conditions

- Run length will be well-defined don't matter (but practically they
(and finite) usually do)

- Not clear how to terminate a
simulation run
