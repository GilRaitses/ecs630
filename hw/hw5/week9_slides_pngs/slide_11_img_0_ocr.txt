Half Width and Number of Replications (conta),

¢ Set half-width =h, solve forn = tata h2

¢ Approximation:
- Replace t by z, corresponding normal critical value

- Pretend that current s will hold for larger samples
- Get

2
n =(z2 S Ss = sample standard deviation from
7 1-a/2} fy2 “initial” number s, of replications

¢ Easier but different approximation

~ n grows quadratically as h decreases
Nn =in
FE

h, = half width from “initial” number n, of replications
